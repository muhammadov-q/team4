# Design system

The look of the web app: dark by default with a matching light mode, flat panels and one lime accent. Why: [[adr/0002-control-room-design-system]]. The tokens are in `frontend/src/app/globals.css`.

## Colour

| Role          | Dark      | Light     | Use                                                               |
| ------------- | --------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Canvas        | `#000000` | `#f4f4f4` | Page background.                                                  |
| Panel         | `#161616` | `#ffffff` | Cards.                                                            |
| Muted surface | `#1f1f1f` | `#ebebeb` | Inputs, the account card, rows inside cards.                      |
| Text          | `#ffffff` | `#0e0e0e` | Headlines and body.                                               |
| Muted text    | `#a3a3a3` | `#5c5c5c` | Descriptions and labels.                                          |
| Lime          | `#e6ff5c` | `#e6ff5c` | Primary buttons, the current page in the sidebar and status dots. |

Lime is the only accent. Errors use an icon, wording and a muted surface rather than red.

## Type

Schibsted Grotesk for everything, JetBrains Mono for technical labels, sizes and code.

## Surfaces

- No borders and no shadows on containers. They're separated by background: canvas, then panel, then muted surface.
- Corners are 8px on buttons, 16px on inputs and 20px on cards.
- Keyboard focus still shows a ring.

## Layout

- Signed-in pages share a sidebar: the app's pages at the top; Docs, Source, the theme switch and the account card at the bottom. Docs and Source are for the team, not for people reading pages, so they stay small.
- Collapsed, the sidebar shows icons with their names on hover, and `T4` in place of the name. Below 1024px it is always collapsed.
