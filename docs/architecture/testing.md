# Testing

Tests are written with the code, in the same PR ([[workflow/definition-of-done]]).

## Backend conventions

- Tests that need the database take the `db` fixture from `backend/src/app/tests/conftest.py`: a fresh, migrated SQLite file per test.
- App and ML code is fully annotated. Tests are type checked too, but test functions and fixtures don't need annotations.
- Tests that need a trained model skip when it's missing, so they don't run in CI. Swap in a fake model where you can, like `FakeModel` in `backend/src/ml/tests/test_knn_predictor.py`.

## Frontend conventions

- Query by role and label (`getByRole`, `getByLabelText`), not by class names.
- `renderWithProviders` in `frontend/src/test/render.tsx` gives each test a fresh query client.
- Stub the network with `vi.stubGlobal('fetch', ...)`. Unit tests never call a real backend.
