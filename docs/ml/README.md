# Machine learning
The first version of the backend runs a mock predictor, `DummyPredictor`, that ignore the image and returns a fixed value following the current Predictor output. 

For now, we have a `KnnPredictor`. It consist of a pipeline finding artifacts on a picture that may be a digit. Then it preprocess the artifact to have a 28x28 sample to compare using a KNN and then predict the digit. More details can be found on the [dedicated model page](models/KNN).

Nothing decided yet. The backend runs a mock predictor, `DummyPredictor`, that ignores the image and returns a fixed value, so the app works end to end before a real model is in ([[architecture/design-patterns]]).

This note gets the tasks, datasets, splits and metrics once the team agrees on them. Each model we then use gets a card in [[models/README|models]].
